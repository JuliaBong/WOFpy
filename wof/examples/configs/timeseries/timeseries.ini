# When we were testing, we exposed uWSGI on a network port.

# Since these components are operating on the same computer, a Unix socket is preferred because it is more secure and faster.
# We'll call the socket myproject.sock and place it in this directory.
# We'll also have to change the permissions on the socket.
# We'll be giving the Nginx group ownership of the uWSGI process later on, so we need to make sure the group owner of the socket can read information from it and write to it.
# We will also clean up the socket when the process stops by adding the "vacuum" option.

An automated confi

Needed for CZO.

Single DataSource Type
    * option 1:
        * networks a paths, aka how it works now
        * object of configuration obejcts and properties (connection strings) 
            * object so that they can be created by code.
        * example code to read from a directory, create configuration object
        * add a json service to deliver a list of networks at this endpoint
    * option 2:
        * use the Network:SiteCode to route to a datasource
        * requires some more funk, since an ODM1 datasource and other data sources are single

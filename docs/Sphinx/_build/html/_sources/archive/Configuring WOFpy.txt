.. _Configuring WOFpy:

*****************
Configuring WOFpy
*****************

=======
Example
=======

Example for running the code on your local Windows machine:

#. Populate an ODM database on an instance of SQL Server.  You can download one from the ODM page at http://his.cuahsi.org.

#. Make a private_config.py file in your local folder and add a line that says database_connection_string = '[YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING]'.

#. Open a Command Window in the same folder as the runserver module and enter: python runserver_[dbname].py

   *Tip: In the folder tree view in Windows Explorer, hold down the shift key and right-click on a folder to see the option for opening a command window in that folder.*

#. In your command window you should see a message that says "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/".  Congratulations, your development server is operational!

#. You may now visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 with your web browser.  Other URLS to visit include:

* /GetSite?siteCode=XXX,YYY

* /GetSiteInfo?siteCode=XXX

* /GetVariableInfo?varCode=ABC

* /GetValues?siteCode=XXX&varCode=ABC&startDateTime=2010-01-01:12:00&endDateTime=2010-02-01-01:12:00

Customizing a data access object (dao) for your data
----------------------------------------------------

To Make a New DAO:

#. Create a new folder in /daos to put all your dao code.

#. Write a new DAO class based on BaseDao in base_dao.py.  The methods should return objects as defined in base_models.py

#. Write a new config file as those found in /config

#. Write a new runserver script (see runserver_flask.py as an example) to use the new DAO you implemented.
